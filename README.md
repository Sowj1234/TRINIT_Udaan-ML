# TRINIT_Udaan-ML
I have uploaded 4 code files , i was not able to complete the object detection code fully

1.try_TRINITT.py : this shows images with the bounding boxes of the given annotation file
2.TriNITT.py : this code contains CNN for binary classiication for damaged or not damaged roads
3.testing.py : this code was written to test the modl with unseeen images
4.YOLO : i tried to use a pretrained model (YOLOv4) for object detection but i was unable to fully complete this part due to insufficient prior knowledge
